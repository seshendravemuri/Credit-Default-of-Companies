# Credit-Default-of-Companies
The objective of this project is to build a model which can identify the right set of business firms who are predicted to default. Basically, build a model predicting their probability of Default. 3,541 observations of various companiesâ€™ financial parameters are given in the dataset. A separate validation dataset is given to test out this model. For both of these datasets, the default variable is also given (or needs to be calculated based on the Net.Worth.Next.Year). This will be the dependent variable for the model.
